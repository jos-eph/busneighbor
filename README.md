# Purpose
(New repo)   

* Build a project entirely in plain vanilla JavaScript, with no frameworks
* Use the Jest unit testing framework
* Fill a gap for responsive, multi-transit vehicle tracking

# Test
To run unit tests, configure by running `npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest`. Then, run `npx jest --coverage`.

# License
TBD, but your first clue is that I don't mind the source being public :-)
